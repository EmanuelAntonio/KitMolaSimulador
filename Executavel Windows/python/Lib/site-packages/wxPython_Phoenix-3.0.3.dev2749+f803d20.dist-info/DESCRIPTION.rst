wxPython_Phoenix is a new implementation of wxPython focused on
improving speed, maintainability and extensibility. Just like "Classic"
wxPython it wraps the wxWidgets C++ toolkit and provides access to the user
interface portions of the wx API, enabling Python applications to have a GUI
on Windows, Macs or Unix systems with a native look and feel and requiring
very little (if any) platform specific code.
